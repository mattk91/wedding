                We recommend the Highfield House Hotel, as it's  located a couple of minutes walk away from the church
                and a short car ride from the reception venue. We've personally tested out this hotel and thought it was ideal so
                we block-booked a bunch of rooms for the 19th and 20th August, at a discounted rate of Â£85 per night including breakfast.

                There are plenty of other places to stay in Southampton, so feel free to make your own plans to stay elsewhere if you like!
