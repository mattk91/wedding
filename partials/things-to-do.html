        <h3>Hidden History and Dancing Man Brewery</h3>
        <p>This interesting walking tour of Southampton’s Hidden History illustrates the lives of the people and city of Southampton in an informative but light hearted manner from the time of the Romans up to that of Henry VIII and beyond, including visits to some of the City’s many vaults. Southampton’s important maritime and commercial history is described as is its role in conflicts from the Battle of Agincourt through to the Normandy Landings on D-Day including a visit to the unique American Wall. The walk passes where the Mayflower and Speedwell departed from Southampton and stops at monuments honouring the Pilgrim Fathers.</p>
        <p>To conclude, enjoy a taste of home brewed beers whilst listening to an entertaining story of the Woolhouse that was built in the 14th century for storing wool and used in the 19th century as a prison for Napoleonic French prisoners of war. In the 20th century Edwin Moon used a corner of his engineering workshop to design and construct his own Moonbeam monoplane which he flew in 1910. The Woolhouse has been tastefully renovated in 2015 maintaining its valuable history and is now the home of The Dancing Man brewery.

        <h3>Titanic Trail with Cream Tea</h3>
        <p>This guided walk will take you back in time and show you where and how the passengers and crew spent their last night on land before boarding the famous RMS Titanic for her Maiden Voyage on 10th April 1912.
